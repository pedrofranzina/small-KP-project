            <h3>premium | open</h3>
            <p>Getting started with flexbox is easy. A nice little display: flex and you have columns.

                Then it's time for the hard part: figuring out what strange combination of justifying, aligning, growing
                (or shrinking), you need to cobble together to get it to behave the way you need it to.

                This course has everything you need to take control of flexbox and start using it to create components,
                and layouts, with confidence.</p>

            <h1><a href="#">Beyond CSS</a></h1>
            <h3>premium | open</h3>
            <p>Authoring stylesheets is about more than simply writing a few lines of CSS these days.

                We have pre-processors, post-processors, design systems, and many different naming conventions.

                In this course I'll be looking at using Sass to develope reusable design systems, explore sane naming
                convetions, and use tools like Vite and PostCSS to optimize your builds.</p>
